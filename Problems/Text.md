# *Problem*: Text

Text content in a PDF is all content that consists of rendered text on the page. This can include *Problems* that are [Real Content](Problems/Real-content.md) or [Artifacts](Problems/Artifacts.md). 

## When should I refer to Text as an Issue?

You'll want to refer to Text as an issue whenever you're having problems with rendered text in your PDF. Common examples of Text *Problems* include (but aren't limited to):

- Text content not being read correctly by a screen reader;
- What kinds of tags to use for text;
- How to fix text that hasn't been tagged correctly;
- What to do when text is tagged as an [Artifact](Problems/Artifacts.md);
- How to mark text as an [Artifact](Problems/Artifacts.md);
- What to do when you edit text and the tags in Acrobat inconviently disappears...
