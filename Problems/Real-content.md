# Problem: Real Content
ISO 32000 (the specification for PDF) defines **Real Content** as:

Content in a document that "comprises graphics objects, annotations and form fields representing material intentionally introduced by the documentâ€™s author and necessary to understand the content of the document."

## What does Real Content include?

Simply put, anything inside a PDF document that helps readers understand its purpose is considered "real content". Real Content must be included in the Logical Structure of the PDF.  Content can appear anywhere in a PDF, so the **Logical Structure** provides assistive technology with a way to interpret the order of how content is read to the user. 

## When should I refer to Real Content as an issue?

You'll want to refer to Real Content as an issue when simply referring to an single *Problem* won't suffice. Common examples of referring to real content includes (but not limited to):

- You're not sure of what kind of Problem your issue actually falls under, but you're sure it's related to a *Problem* that includes providing meaning to content;
- Any time you ask a question that begins with the phrase, "I'm not sure what this is related to, but..."
- What kind of tags you should use, and/or where the tag should technically go, and/or how to appropriately use the tag in the first place;
- Those times when you're unsure whether something should even be considered important enough to tag in the first place.
- How to deal with complex images of text that need to be recreated as text content yet preserve the graphics as necessary as well;
- How to deal with text getting lost inside of **Artifacts**;
- How to provide context to poorly interpreted scanned text resulting from lackluster Optical Character Recognition (OCR)...
